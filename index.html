            <h3>What is gentrification?</h3>
            <p>Gentrification is a process of neighborhood change that includes
              economic change in a historically disinvested neighborhood. This
              can be by means of real estate investments and new higher income
              residents moving in, as well as demographic change. This
              demographic change is not only in terms of income level, but also
              in terms of changes in the education level or racial make-up of
              residents. An example of a New York City neighborhood that has
              become gentrified in recent years is Bushwick.

          <p>Gentrification often leads to a loss of affordable housing,
             displacement through rent/price increases, community resentment and
             conflict, unsustainable property prices, increased cost and charges
             to local services, and homelessness.
