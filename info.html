        gentrification:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The historic conditions, especially policies and practices that
          made communities susceptible to gentrification.</li>
          <li>The way that central city disinvestment and investment patterns
          are taking place today as a result of these conditions.</li>
          <li>The ways that gentrification impacts communities.</li>

          <h3 class="pointTitle">Historic Conditions</h3>
          <p>Historic conditions that have led to gentrification include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Redlining: Standards set by the federal government and carried
              out by banks (1930s-1960s) explicitly labeled neighborhoods home
              to predominantly people of color as "risky" and "unfit for
              investment." This meant that many people of color were unable to
              access loans that would have allowed them to buy or repair homes
              in their own neighborhoods.</li>
            <li>White flight: Housing and transportation policies of the
              mid-20th century, such as the GI Bill, fueled the growth of mostly
              white suburbs. The GI Bill promised low-cost mortgage loans for
              WWII soliders. However, due to discrimination, Black veterans were
              often unable to purchase homes in the suburbs.</li>
            <li>Urban renewal: The highway system expansion often occurred in
              low-income neighborhoods, which resulted in the mass clearance of
              homes, businesses, and neighborhood institutions.</li>
            <li>Foreclosure crisis: The crisis left low-income neighborhoods
              vulnerable to investors due to mass forclosures in those areas.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="disinvestmentInvestmentList">
          <h3 class="pointTitle">Central city disinvestment and investment patterns</h3>
          <p>People are going back to historically disinvested neighborhoods
             because of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Relative affordability</li>
            <li>Older, historic housing stock that appeals to new residents</li>
            <li>Close proximity to city centers, and in turn jobs, restaurants,
              and transportation</li>
            <li>Revitalization: cities are investing in the infrastructure and
              transit systems of some neighborhoods in order to appeal to
              newcomers</li>

              <h3 class="pointTitle">Impact of gentrification on communities</h3>
              <p>Gentrification is usually associated with displacement, which
                means that in some communities, long-term residents can't afford
                to stay to benefit from the neighborhoods' new investments.</p>
              <p>Another type of displacement is cultural displacement, in which
                 changes in the make-up of a neighborhood leads to a resident
                 feeling out of place in their own home.</p>
